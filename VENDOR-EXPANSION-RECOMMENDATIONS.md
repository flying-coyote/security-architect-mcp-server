---

## Not Recommended (Research Findings)

### Duplicates Identified

**Microsoft Azure Sentinel** vs **Microsoft Sentinel**
- Appear to be same product in database
- **Action**: Consolidate to single entry (keep "Microsoft Sentinel")
- **Estimated Effort**: 10 minutes

### Vendors Outside Scope

**Tines** (SOAR Platform)
- Named Leader in GigaOm SOAR Report 2024
- However, SOAR/security orchestration is outside current database scope
- Would require adding new "SOAR" category
- **Decision**: Defer unless expanding to security operations tools

**LimaCharlie** (SecOps Cloud Platform)
- $10.2M Series A funding (Feb 2024)
- Primarily EDR/XDR platform (overlaps with existing vendors)
- Less established in security data analytics space
- **Decision**: Skip - insufficient differentiation

**Velociraptor** (Open-source DFIR tool)
- Acquired by Rapid7
- Excellent for forensics/IR, but NOT a data platform/analytics engine
- Used for artifact collection, not continuous security analytics
- **Decision**: Skip - outside scope (investigation tool, not data infrastructure)

### Vendors with Insufficient Differentiation

**Materialize** (Streaming Database)
- Real-time streaming database with production deployments
- Lacks security-specific differentiation vs. existing streaming platforms
- More DevOps/data engineering tool than security-native platform
- **Decision**: Skip - insufficient security analytics market presence

**Gravwell** (Security Analytics)
- $15.4M Series A funding (Oct 2025)
- Limited analyst coverage, smaller market presence
- **Decision**: Skip - insufficient differentiation from existing 16 SIEM vendors

**Snowflake Horizon**
- NOT a separate product (Snowflake's built-in governance layer)
- Snowflake Data Cloud already in database
- **Action**: Ensure Snowflake entry mentions Horizon Catalog capabilities

---

---

## Strategic Value Analysis

### Why Expand SIEM Category?

**Current Gaps**:
- Missing 3 Gartner Leaders (Gurucul, Palo Alto, SentinelOne)
- XDR+SIEM convergence trend not represented
- Identity-centric SIEM missing (Gurucul)

**Value of Expansion**:
- Comprehensive SIEM coverage for book/MCP server
- Represents current market (XDR, AI-driven, cloud-native trends)
- Fills architect decision criteria (identity analytics, XDR convergence)

### Why Expand Data Virtualization?

**Current State**: Smallest category (3 vendors)

**Value of Expansion**:
- Query federation increasingly important for security analytics
- Starburst is major commercial player (fills Trino commercial gap)
- TCO savings documented (61% reduction)

### Why Add Apache Paimon?

**Strategic Value**:
- Real-time lakehouse is emerging architecture pattern
- Completes table format coverage (Iceberg, Delta, Hudi, **Paimon**)
- Streaming-first approach differentiates from batch-optimized alternatives
- Chinese production deployments validate at massive scale

---

## Estimated Effort

### Time Investment

**Priority Vendors** (6 vendors):
- Research and validation: 1.5-2 hours
- Vendor profile creation: 1.5-2 hours
- Evidence source documentation: 0.5-1 hour
- **Total**: 3.5-5 hours

**Optional Vendors** (3 vendors):
- Research and validation: 1-1.5 hours
- Vendor profile creation: 1-1.5 hours
- Evidence source documentation: 0.5-1 hour
- **Total**: 2.5-4 hours

**Cleanup**:
- Consolidate duplicates: 0.5 hours

**Grand Total**: 6.5-9.5 hours for complete expansion

### Resource Requirements

- Access to Gartner MQ / Forrester Wave reports (for positioning validation)
- Vendor websites for official pricing/documentation
- Case study validation (production deployments)
- GitHub metrics for open-source vendors (DuckDB, Apache Paimon, Apache Impala)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Evidence quality drops** | Low | All vendors pre-validated with Tier 1-3 evidence |
| **Vendor bias toward commercial** | Low | 2 of 6 priority vendors are OSS (Impala, Paimon) |
| **Category imbalance** | Low | Expansion targets smallest category (Data Virtualization) |
| **Maintenance burden increases** | Medium | 9 new vendors = 9 more to monitor. Automation mitigates. |

**Overall Risk**: ✅ LOW - Expansion maintains quality standards
