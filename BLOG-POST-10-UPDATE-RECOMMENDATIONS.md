# Blog Post #10 Update Recommendations

**Document Purpose**: Actionable update list for security-data-commons-blog Post #10
**Post Title**: "Introducing the Security Architecture Decision Tool"
**Post URL**: `/published/10-introducing-security-architecture-decision-tool.md`
**Published**: October 23, 2025
**Status**: Published with pre-Session 2/3 statistics (version skew)
**Priority**: Medium (post is "close enough" for readers, but should be corrected for accuracy)

---

## Context

Blog Post #10 was published October 23, 2025 using MCP server statistics from pre-Session 2/3. Sessions 2 & 3 occurred the same day (October 23), creating version skew. The post features accurate narrative/concepts but outdated vendor count, test metrics, and production status.

**Impact**: Minimal (readers won't notice 64 vs 71 vendor difference), but accuracy matters for credibility.

---

## Required Updates

### 1. Vendor Count (3 locations)

**Line 75** (Database Scope section):
```markdown
Current: "The tool includes 64 security data platforms across 9 categories:"
Update:  "The tool includes 71 security data platforms across 9 categories:"
```

**Line 133** (Implementation Status section):
```markdown
Current: "- **Database**: 64 vendors with evidence-based evaluation[^database-scope]"
Update:  "- **Database**: 71 vendors with evidence-based evaluation[^database-scope]"
```

**Footnote [^database-scope]** (Line 183):
```markdown
Current: "[^database-scope]: The 64-vendor database represents comprehensive coverage..."
Update:  "[^database-scope]: The 71-vendor database represents comprehensive coverage..."
```

### 2. Test Metrics (1 location)

**Line 134** (Implementation Status section):
```markdown
Current: "- **Test Coverage**: 178 passing tests, 88% code coverage"
Update:  "- **Test Coverage**: 144 passing tests, 87% code coverage"
```

**Note**: The 178/88% metrics were aspirational/estimated. Actual implementation achieved 144/87% which is still excellent.

### 3. Production Status (1 location)

**Line 136** (Implementation Status section):
```markdown
Current: "- **Status**: Beta testing available, production target December 2025"
Update:  "- **Status**: Production deployed (October 2025), beta testing recruitment in progress"
```

**Rationale**: MCP server production deployment was verified in Session 3 (October 23, same day as post publication). The "December 2025" target is now past tense.

### 4. Evidence Quality Metrics (Optional Enhancement)

**Optional addition after Line 88** (Database Scope section):
```markdown
Add after "Monthly refresh cycles":

- Evidence quality: 110 sources (84% Tier A = analyst reports + production deployments)
- Analyst coverage: 46.5% of vendors validated by Gartner MQ or Forrester Wave reports
- Production validation: 35.2% of open source vendors deployed in Fortune 500 environments
```

**Rationale**: Session 2 evidence backfill (110 sources, 84% Tier A) significantly strengthens database credibility. This is a compelling stat worth highlighting, though optional since post is already published.

## Implementation Notes

### Version Control
- Update file: `security-data-commons-blog/published/10-introducing-security-architecture-decision-tool.md`
- Commit message: `üìù Post #10 Update - MCP server stats refresh (71 vendors, production deployed)`
- Branch: `main` (or current active branch for blog project)

### Substack Sync
If blog uses Substack as single source of truth:
- Updates need to be made in **Substack editor**, not just GitHub markdown
- GitHub markdown should mirror Substack published version
- Check: Does `published/` folder contain Substack exports or independent drafts?

If GitHub is source of truth:
- Update markdown in `published/` folder
- Manually update Substack post (edit published post)

**Question for User**: Is GitHub or Substack the source of truth for published posts?

### SEO Considerations
- Minor stat updates (64 ‚Üí 71, test metrics) do NOT require new publication date
- Keep "**Publication Date**: October 23, 2025" unchanged (original publication date)
- Substack does NOT penalize post edits for SEO

---

## Optional Enhancements (Beyond Stats Refresh)

### 1. Add Session 2 Vendor Highlights (Optional)

**After Line 82** (Database Scope section), optionally add:
```markdown
Recent additions (October 2025) include:
- **Gurucul Next-Gen SIEM**: Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader 2025 (UEBA + XDR + Identity Analytics)
- **Palo Alto XSIAM**: Forrester Strong Performer 2025 (AI-driven, Cortex XDL lakehouse architecture)
- **SentinelOne Singularity**: Gartner Endpoint Protection Leader 2025 (OCSF-native SIEM + EDR)
- **Apache Impala**: Query engine with NYSE, Quest Diagnostics production deployments
```

**Rationale**: Showcases high-profile vendor additions (Gartner/Forrester validated), demonstrates database evolution post-publication. Adds credibility but NOT required for accuracy.

### 2. Link to Comprehensive Alignment Analysis (Optional)

**After Line 136** (Implementation Status section), optionally add:
```markdown
**Technical Documentation**: [MCP Server GitHub](https://github.com/flying-coyote/security-architect-mcp-server) | [Comprehensive Design Document](https://github.com/flying-coyote/security-architect-mcp-server/blob/main/ULTRATHINK-MCP-SERVER-DESIGN.md)
```

**Rationale**: Provides deep-dive links for technical readers. Not required but improves post utility.

## Timeline Recommendation

**Priority**: Medium (not urgent, but should be corrected)

**Suggested Timeline**:
- **Immediate** (if actively working on blog): Update during next blog session
- **Deferred** (if focused on other projects): Update when preparing Wave 2 posts (Posts #17-21) that reference MCP tool

**Blocking**: No (post is functional as-is, stats are "close enough" for readers)

**User Decision Required**: When to apply these updates (next blog session vs. deferred to Wave 2 prep)
