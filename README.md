# Security Architecture Decision MCP Server

**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete, Production Deployed - 71 Vendors, 7 Tools, Beta Testing Ready
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30
**Purpose**: AI-powered interactive decision support tool for cybersecurity architects

---

## Vision

Transform the "Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity" book's decision framework from static content into an interactive, AI-powered architectural decision support tool that helps architects filter the vendor landscape from 80+ platforms to 3-5 personalized finalists in a 30-minute guided conversation.

---

## What It Does

**For Cybersecurity Architects**:
- Walk through a guided conversation with Claude to identify the right security data platform for YOUR organization
- Apply the Chapter 3-4 decision framework interactively (no manual 40-page RFP needed)
- Receive personalized architecture recommendation report with honest trade-offs
- Get 3-5 vendor finalists tailored to your constraints (team size, budget, compliance, vendor preference)

**Example Conversation**:
```
Architect: "I need help choosing a security data platform"

Claude: "I'm connected to the Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity decision framework.
Let's find the right platform for YOUR organization.

First, how many data engineers do you have on your security team?"

Architect: "We have 0 dedicated data engineers. Our team is 15 SOC analysts."

Claude: "Got it. With 0-1 data engineers, we'll prioritize operational simplicity.
I'm filtering out self-hosted platforms like Trino clusters...

[MCP Tool: filter_vendors(team_capacity="0-1")]
[Result: 80 vendors → 24 viable candidates]

Next, what's your annual security data platform budget?"

Architect: "$300K-$500K annually"

Claude: "Budget under $500K means enterprise SIEM per-GB pricing is likely cost-prohibitive.
Applying cost filters...

[MCP Tool: filter_vendors(budget="<500K")]
[Result: 24 vendors → 12 viable candidates]

Let's continue with data sovereignty requirements..."
```

**Outcome**: 15-30 minute conversation produces personalized architecture recommendation report with 3-5 finalist vendors, POC evaluation criteria, TCO projection, and honest trade-off documentation.

---

## Strategic Value

### For Architects
- **Time Savings**: 30 minutes vs. 2-4 weeks manual vendor evaluation
- **Decision Confidence**: Evidence-based filtering, validated by book research
- **Personalization**: Tailored to YOUR constraints, not generic best practices
- **Risk Mitigation**: Honest trade-off documentation prevents buyer's remorse

### For Book Project
- **Living Validation**: Captures real architectural decisions, validates hypotheses
- **Content Generation**: Decision conversations → blog posts, case studies
- **Community Engagement**: Interactive tool builds book community
- **Differentiation**: "First security architecture book with AI decision support companion"

### For Research Portfolio
- **Constraint Discovery**: What organizational constraints matter most?
- **Vendor Landscape Evolution**: Track which vendors gain/lose traction
- **Hypothesis Refinement**: Real-world validation of book's 29 hypotheses

## MCP Architecture

### Resources (Data Exposed to Claude)

1. **Vendor Database**: 71 security data platforms across 9 categories with capability matrix
   - 110 evidence sources (84% Tier A quality = 92 Tier A sources)
   - 46.5% analyst coverage (33 vendors with Gartner MQ, Forrester Wave)
   - 35.2% production validation (25 OSS vendors with Fortune 500 deployments)
2. **Decision State**: Current architect's conversation progress (session persistence)
3. **Chapter Framework**: Chapter 3-4 decision tree logic from book

### Tools (Functions Callable by Claude)

1. **list_vendors()**: Browse 71 vendors by category (SIEM, Query Engine, Lakehouse, etc.)
2. **apply_foundational_filters()**: NEW - Phase 1 foundational architecture filtering (table format, catalog, transformation, query engine)
3. **filter_vendors_tier1()**: Apply mandatory organizational filters (team, budget, sovereignty) - Tier 1 (Phase 2)
4. **score_vendors_tier2()**: Score vendors on preferred capabilities with weights 1-3 - Tier 2 (Phase 3)
5. **generate_architecture_report()**: Generate 8-12 page Markdown recommendation report
6. **match_journey_persona()**: Match to Chapter 4 journey (Jennifer/Marcus/Priya)
7. **calculate_tco()**: Calculate 5-year Total Cost of Ownership for a vendor
8. **compare_vendors_tco()**: Compare TCO across multiple vendors (ranked by total cost)

**Decision Flow**: Phase 1 (foundational) → Phase 2 (organizational constraints) → Phase 3 (feature preferences) → Report

### Prompts (Pre-Written Templates)

1. **Decision Interview**: 12-step guided questionnaire with Phase 1 foundational questions (table format, catalog, transformation, query engine) asked before organizational constraints
2. **Journey Matching**: Explains persona match and architecture pattern

## Integration with Book/Blog

### Book Manuscript Integration

**Appendix C**: "Interactive Decision Support Tool"
- Setup guide for Claude Desktop + MCP server
- What you get: 3-5 vendor shortlist, architecture report, TCO projection
- Open source (Apache 2.0 license)

**Chapter 3-4 Callouts**:
- Sidebar note: "Want to apply this framework interactively? See Appendix C"

---

### Blog Integration

**Security Data Commons Blog**:
- **URL**: https://securitydatacommons.substack.com
- **Status**: 43 posts (10 published, 33 drafted #11-43)
- **Publishing Cadence**: 3x/week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)
- **MCP Featured**: Post #10 "Introducing the Security Architecture Decision Tool" (Oct 23, 2025)

**Content Structure** (7 Waves):
- **Wave 1 (#11-16)**: Critical architecture decisions (Iceberg vs Delta, catalog choice, dbt, governance)
- **Wave 2 (#17-21)**: LIGER engine implementation (Netflix ClickHouse, Kafka-Iceberg, query engines)
- **Waves 3-7 (#22-43)**: Detection maturity, OCSF strategy, anti-patterns, MLOps, federated enterprises

**Strategic Insight**: Blog renumbering (Oct 30, 2025) revealed that foundational architecture decisions (table format, catalog) must precede implementation details (query engine, routing). This informs MCP decision interview flow design.

**Content Pipeline** (Phase 3):
1. Architect completes MCP decision conversation
2. Architect grants permission for anonymized case study
3. MCP tool generates blog post draft
4. Human editor reviews + polishes
5. Publish to Security Data Commons blog (Friday expert insights series)

**Target**: 10-20 blog posts/year from anonymized MCP decisions validating blog frameworks
