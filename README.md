# Security Architecture Decision MCP Server

**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Phase 2 In Progress - 64 Vendors, 7 Tools, TCO Calculator Operational
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16
**Purpose**: AI-powered interactive decision support tool for cybersecurity architects

---

## Vision

Transform the "Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity" book's decision framework from static content into an interactive, AI-powered architectural decision support tool that helps architects filter the vendor landscape from 80+ platforms to 3-5 personalized finalists in a 30-minute guided conversation.

---

## What It Does

**For Cybersecurity Architects**:
- Walk through a guided conversation with Claude to identify the right security data platform for YOUR organization
- Apply the Chapter 3-4 decision framework interactively (no manual 40-page RFP needed)
- Receive personalized architecture recommendation report with honest trade-offs
- Get 3-5 vendor finalists tailored to your constraints (team size, budget, compliance, vendor preference)

**Example Conversation**:
```
Architect: "I need help choosing a security data platform"

Claude: "I'm connected to the Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity decision framework.
Let's find the right platform for YOUR organization.

First, how many data engineers do you have on your security team?"

Architect: "We have 0 dedicated data engineers. Our team is 15 SOC analysts."

Claude: "Got it. With 0-1 data engineers, we'll prioritize operational simplicity.
I'm filtering out self-hosted platforms like Trino clusters...

[MCP Tool: filter_vendors(team_capacity="0-1")]
[Result: 80 vendors → 24 viable candidates]

Next, what's your annual security data platform budget?"

Architect: "$300K-$500K annually"

Claude: "Budget under $500K means enterprise SIEM per-GB pricing is likely cost-prohibitive.
Applying cost filters...

[MCP Tool: filter_vendors(budget="<500K")]
[Result: 24 vendors → 12 viable candidates]

Let's continue with data sovereignty requirements..."
```

**Outcome**: 15-30 minute conversation produces personalized architecture recommendation report with 3-5 finalist vendors, POC evaluation criteria, TCO projection, and honest trade-off documentation.

## Strategic Value

### For Architects
- **Time Savings**: 30 minutes vs. 2-4 weeks manual vendor evaluation
- **Decision Confidence**: Evidence-based filtering, validated by book research
- **Personalization**: Tailored to YOUR constraints, not generic best practices
- **Risk Mitigation**: Honest trade-off documentation prevents buyer's remorse

### For Book Project
- **Living Validation**: Captures real architectural decisions, validates hypotheses
- **Content Generation**: Decision conversations → blog posts, case studies
- **Community Engagement**: Interactive tool builds book community
- **Differentiation**: "First security architecture book with AI decision support companion"

### For Research Portfolio
- **Constraint Discovery**: What organizational constraints matter most?
- **Vendor Landscape Evolution**: Track which vendors gain/lose traction
- **Hypothesis Refinement**: Real-world validation of book's 29 hypotheses
