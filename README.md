# Security Architecture Decision MCP Server

**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Design Phase - Ready for Implementation
**Purpose**: AI-powered interactive decision support tool for cybersecurity architects

---

## Vision

Transform the "Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity" book's decision framework from static content into an interactive, AI-powered architectural decision support tool that helps architects filter the vendor landscape from 80+ platforms to 3-5 personalized finalists in a 30-minute guided conversation.

---

## What It Does

**For Cybersecurity Architects**:
- Walk through a guided conversation with Claude to identify the right security data platform for YOUR organization
- Apply the Chapter 3-4 decision framework interactively (no manual 40-page RFP needed)
- Receive personalized architecture recommendation report with honest trade-offs
- Get 3-5 vendor finalists tailored to your constraints (team size, budget, compliance, vendor preference)

**Example Conversation**:
```
Architect: "I need help choosing a security data platform"

Claude: "I'm connected to the Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity decision framework.
Let's find the right platform for YOUR organization.

First, how many data engineers do you have on your security team?"

Architect: "We have 0 dedicated data engineers. Our team is 15 SOC analysts."

Claude: "Got it. With 0-1 data engineers, we'll prioritize operational simplicity.
I'm filtering out self-hosted platforms like Trino clusters...

[MCP Tool: filter_vendors(team_capacity="0-1")]
[Result: 80 vendors → 24 viable candidates]

Next, what's your annual security data platform budget?"

Architect: "$300K-$500K annually"

Claude: "Budget under $500K means enterprise SIEM per-GB pricing is likely cost-prohibitive.
Applying cost filters...

[MCP Tool: filter_vendors(budget="<500K")]
[Result: 24 vendors → 12 viable candidates]

Let's continue with data sovereignty requirements..."
```

**Outcome**: 15-30 minute conversation produces personalized architecture recommendation report with 3-5 finalist vendors, POC evaluation criteria, TCO projection, and honest trade-off documentation.

## Strategic Value

### For Architects
- **Time Savings**: 30 minutes vs. 2-4 weeks manual vendor evaluation
- **Decision Confidence**: Evidence-based filtering, validated by book research
- **Personalization**: Tailored to YOUR constraints, not generic best practices
- **Risk Mitigation**: Honest trade-off documentation prevents buyer's remorse

### For Book Project
- **Living Validation**: Captures real architectural decisions, validates hypotheses
- **Content Generation**: Decision conversations → blog posts, case studies
- **Community Engagement**: Interactive tool builds book community
- **Differentiation**: "First security architecture book with AI decision support companion"

### For Research Portfolio
- **Constraint Discovery**: What organizational constraints matter most?
- **Vendor Landscape Evolution**: Track which vendors gain/lose traction
- **Hypothesis Refinement**: Real-world validation of book's 29 hypotheses

2. **Decision State**: Current architect's conversation progress
3. **Chapter Framework**: Chapter 3-4 decision tree logic

### Tools (Functions Callable by Claude)

1. **filter_vendors_tier_1()**: Applies mandatory filters (team, budget, sovereignty)
2. **score_vendors_tier_2()**: Scores vendors on preferred capabilities (3× weight)
3. **generate_architecture_report()**: Produces 12-15 page recommendation report
4. **calculate_tco()**: Projects 5-year Total Cost of Ownership
5. **match_journey_persona()**: Identifies Chapter 4 journey match (Jennifer/Marcus/Priya)

### Prompts (Pre-Written Templates)

1. **Decision Interview**: 12-step guided questionnaire
2. **Journey Matching**: Explains persona match and architecture pattern

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Decision Tree (Month 1-2) - **PRIORITY**

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ MCP server basic structure (Python 3.10+, MCP SDK 1.2.0+)
- ✅ Vendor database (80+ vendors, manual JSON file)
- ✅ Decision interview prompt (12-step guided conversation)
- ✅ Filter/score tools (Tier 1-2 logic from Chapter 3)
- ✅ Architecture report generator (Markdown output)
- ✅ Journey matching tool (Jennifer/Marcus/Priya personas)

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks at 20 hours/week (110-150 hours total)

**Success Criteria**:
- 3 beta testers complete decision interview successfully
- Vendor landscape filtered 80 → 3-5 finalists
- Architecture reports generated with honest trade-offs

---

### Phase 2: Living Literature Review Integration (Month 3-4)

**Deliverables**:
- IT Harvest API integration (if partnership succeeds) OR web scraping fallback
- Quarterly vendor database update pipeline
- Cost calculator tool (TCO projections)
- Hypothesis validation pipeline

**Timeline**: 5-7 weeks (90-130 hours total)

---

### Phase 3: Blog Integration & Content Generation (Month 5-6)

**Deliverables**:
- Blog post generator (decision conversation → anonymized case study)
- POC test suite generator
- Use Case Library integration (detection requirements mapping)
- Expert interview synthesizer

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks (75-105 hours total)
