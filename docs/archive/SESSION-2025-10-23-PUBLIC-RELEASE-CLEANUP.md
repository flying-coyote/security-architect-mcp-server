- **After**: Removed entirely or replaced with "production deployments, peer-reviewed research"

### Production Deployment Examples
- **Before**: "Okta (Jake Thomas) - 100K QPS, sub-second latency"
- **After**: "Enterprise A - 100K QPS, sub-second latency (2024)"

### Network References
- **Before**: "Expert network (1,444 thought leaders)"
- **After**: Removed section entirely

## Files With Remaining References (Archived/Historical)

These files contain references but are session archives and do not need cleanup:

1. `.claude/sessions/2025-10-16-phase1-complete.md`
2. `.claude/sessions/2025-10-16-phase2-tco-calculator.md`
3. `docs/SESSION-2025-10-23-SESSION-2-VENDOR-EXPANSION.md`
4. `docs/SESSION-2025-10-23-SESSION-3-PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT.md`
5. `docs/QUALITY-REVIEW-FINAL-SESSION-2.md`

**Rationale**: Session archives are historical records of work completed. They are not primary documentation and are stored in `docs/` or `.claude/sessions/` directories which are typically not the first files users read.

---

## ULTRATHINK-MCP-SERVER-DESIGN.md

**Status**: NOT CLEANED (intentional)

This 18,000-word comprehensive design document contains ~20 references to IT Harvest and expert names.

**Decision**: Leave as-is for now because:
- It's a design document (historical artifact from October 14, 2025 design phase)
- Not primary user-facing documentation (README and PROJECT-BRIEF are entry points)
- Contains detailed design rationale that would be degraded by genericization
- Can be moved to `docs/archive/` or `.claude/design-archive/` if needed

**Future Action**: If repository made public, consider either:
- Option A: Move to `docs/archive/ORIGINAL-DESIGN.md` with note "Historical design document"
- Option B: Create sanitized version `ULTRATHINK-MCP-SERVER-DESIGN-PUBLIC.md`
- Option C: Add disclaimer at top: "Note: This design document contains references to potential partnerships that did not materialize"

---

## Verification

### Pre-Cleanup Status
```bash
grep -r "IT Harvest" --include="*.md" . | wc -l
# Result: ~35 matches

grep -r "Jake Thomas\|Lisa Cao\|Paul Agbabian" --include="*.md" . | wc -l
# Result: ~15 matches
```

### Post-Cleanup Status (Primary Docs)
```bash
grep "IT Harvest\|Jake Thomas\|Lisa Cao\|Paul Agbabian" \
  PROJECT-BRIEF.md README.md .claude/CLAUDE.md .claude/skills/**/*.md
# Result: 0 matches in primary documentation
```

### Remaining References
- Session archives: 7 files (intentionally preserved)
- Design document: 1 file (ULTRATHINK, decision pending)

## Quality Standards Maintained

‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Quality**: All anonymized examples still maintain evidence tier classification
‚úÖ **Production Deployment Validation**: Examples changed from "Okta (Jake Thomas)" to "Enterprise A (2024)" - still shows validation occurred
‚úÖ **Intellectual Honesty**: No factual claims removed, only sensitive identifiers
‚úÖ **Vendor Neutrality**: No vendor assessment changes made

## Next Steps

**Immediate**:
- ‚úÖ Push changes to remote repository
- ‚úÖ Document cleanup work (this file)

**Before Public Release**:
- [ ] Decide on ULTRATHINK-MCP-SERVER-DESIGN.md handling (archive vs. sanitize vs. disclaimer)
- [ ] Review session archive files - consider moving to `.claude/sessions/archive/` or adding README note
- [ ] Review docs/ folder - some files may reference partnerships in context
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with vendor update contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add LICENSE files (Apache 2.0 for code, CC BY-SA 4.0 for vendor data)

**Repository Structure Recommendation**:
```
security-architect-mcp-server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (‚úÖ cleaned)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT-BRIEF.md (‚úÖ cleaned)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md (‚úÖ cleaned)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skills/ (‚úÖ cleaned)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/ (‚ö†Ô∏è archived content, add README note)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ USAGE.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/ (‚ö†Ô∏è move historical sessions here)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION-*.md (‚ö†Ô∏è historical content)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ULTRATHINK-MCP-SERVER-DESIGN.md (‚ö†Ô∏è decision pending)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Genericization Pattern**: "Company (Contact)" ‚Üí "Enterprise A (2024)" preserves evidence tier while removing identifiers
2. **Partnership References**: Replace specific partnerships with capability descriptions ("automated updates" vs "IT Harvest API")
3. **Expert Network**: Replace with output descriptions ("production deployments, peer-reviewed research")
4. **Session Archives**: Preserve as historical record, organize in archive folders with README notes

**Status**: PRIMARY DOCUMENTATION CLEANED ‚úÖ
**Branch**: mcp-hybrid-week1-simplification
**Ready for**: Public release (after ULTRATHINK decision)
