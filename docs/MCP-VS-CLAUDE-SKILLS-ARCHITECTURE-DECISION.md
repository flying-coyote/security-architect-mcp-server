# MCP Server vs Claude Skills Architecture Decision

**Created**: October 19, 2025
**Methodology**: UltraThink FRAME-ANALYZE-SYNTHESIZE
**Decision Required By**: November 15, 2025 (Month 2 - before Phase 3 planning)
**Status**: ANALYSIS COMPLETE, RECOMMENDATION READY

---

## Executive Summary

**Decision Question**: Should security-architect-mcp-server remain as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, convert to Claude Skills architecture, or adopt a hybrid approach?

**Current State** (Phase 1 Complete, Oct 16):
- ✅ 178 tests passing, 88% coverage
- ✅ 8 MCP tools operational
- ✅ 64 vendors in database
- ✅ TCO calculator functional

**Recommendation**: **HYBRID APPROACH** - Keep MCP server for vendor database/decision state persistence, convert decision workflows to Claude Skills

**Rationale** (detailed below):
- MCP strengths: Standardized protocol, resource management, multi-client support, vendor database persistence
- Claude Skills strengths: Simpler deployment, better Claude Code integration, no server infrastructure, easier updates
- Hybrid: Best of both - MCP handles data/resources, Claude Skills handle workflows

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks conversion (30-40 hours) if approved

---

## PHASE 1: FRAME - Problem Definition

### F - FUNDAMENTALS: Core Elements

**The Decision**:
Should the security architect decision support tool continue as an MCP server, or be reimagined as Claude Skills?

**Current Architecture** (MCP Server):
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (Anthropic standard)
- **Deployment**: Claude Desktop integration via MCP config
- **Components**:
  - 8 MCP Tools: list_vendors, filter_tier1, score_tier2, generate_report, match_journey, calculate_tco, compare_tco, generate_poc_suite
  - 2 MCP Resources: vendor_database (vendors.json 64+ vendors), decision_state (session persistence)
  - 2 MCP Prompts: decision_interview (12-step), journey_matching (persona narratives)
- **State Management**: decision_state.json (session persistence across conversations)
- **Data Storage**: vendor_database.json (80+ vendors target), capability matrix, cost models

**Alternative Architecture** (Claude Skills):
- **Protocol**: Claude Code native skills
- **Deployment**: `.claude/skills/` directory (automatic discovery)
- **Components**:
  - Skills: security-vendor-filter, architecture-recommendation-generator, tco-calculator, journey-persona-matcher
  - Data: vendor_database.json (same), decision_state.json (markdown or JSON in project)
  - Prompts: Embedded in skill STEPS section
- **State Management**: Project files (decision-state.md or JSON)
- **Data Storage**: Same vendor_database.json, accessed via file reads

**What Changed**:
- **October 2025**: Claude Skills feature officially released (production-ready)
- **October 17, 2025**: 21 Claude Skills deployed across 9 projects (6 personal + 15 project-specific)
- **October 19, 2025**: Memory Prompts Phase 1 complete - 4 skills redesigned with standardized 10-section template
- **Context**: MCP server designed October 14 when Claude Skills were newer, now mature ecosystem exists

**Triggering Factors**:
1. **Ecosystem Maturity**: Claude Skills now production-ready with 21 skills operational
2. **Deployment Complexity**: MCP requires separate server process + Claude Desktop config vs Claude Skills auto-discovery
3. **Integration Patterns**: 21 existing skills provide proven patterns for decision workflows
4. **Maintenance Burden**: MCP server + vendor database + Claude Skills = 3 systems vs Claude Skills + vendor database = 2 systems

### R - RELATIONSHIPS: Component Interactions

**Current MCP Architecture Relationships**:

```
[Architect] ↔ [Claude Desktop] ↔ [MCP Server Process]
                                       ↓
                            [8 MCP Tools]
                                       ↓

- Claude Desktop → MCP Server (requires server running, config file correct)
- MCP Server → vendor_database.json (resource dependency)
- Decision workflow → decision_state.json (session persistence)
- Tools → Pydantic schemas (validation)
- Architect → 12-step interview (guided conversation)

**Integration Points**:
- Book manuscript → Vendor database sync (Appendix D ↔ vendors.json)
- Blog → Anonymized case studies (decision_state.json → blog posts)
- Literature Review → Vendor validation (IT Harvest partnership)
- Expert interviews → Capability updates (Jake Thomas, Lisa Cao, Paul Agbabian)

**Proposed Claude Skills Architecture Relationships**:

```
[Architect] ↔ [Claude Code] ↔ [Claude Skills (auto-discovered)]
                                       ↓
                    [security-vendor-filter skill]
                    [tco-calculator skill]
                    [journey-persona-matcher skill]
                    [architecture-report-generator skill]
                                       ↓
                        [vendor_database.json (file read)]
                        [decision-state.md (project file)]
                                       ↓
                         [Architecture Report.md]
```

**Dependencies**:
- Claude Code → .claude/skills/ directory (auto-discovery)
- Skills → vendor_database.json (Read tool access)
- Decision workflow → decision-state.md or JSON (project file)
- Skills → 10-section template (standardized structure from Phase 1)
- Architect → Skills triggered by conversation (not rigid 12-step)

**Integration Points** (same as MCP):
- Book manuscript → Vendor database sync (unchanged)
- Blog → Anonymized case studies (decision-state.md → blog posts)
- Literature Review → Vendor validation (unchanged)
- Expert interviews → Capability updates (unchanged)

---

**Hybrid Architecture Relationships**:

```
[Architect] ↔ [Claude Code] ↔ [Claude Skills] + [MCP Server (data only)]
                                       ↓              ↓
                    [Claude Skills handle workflow]  [MCP Resources provide data]
                    - vendor-filter                  - vendor_database (Resource)
                    - tco-calculator                 - decision_state (Resource)
                    - journey-matcher
                    - report-generator
                                       ↓
                        [Architecture Report.md]
```

**Benefits**:
- **MCP**: Handles data persistence (vendor database, decision state) with standardized protocol
- **Claude Skills**: Handles workflows (filtering, scoring, recommendations) with simpler deployment
- **Best of Both**: Standardized data (MCP Resources) + flexible workflows (Claude Skills)

---

### A - ASSUMPTIONS: Hidden Premises

**Assumption 1: MCP Server Provides Unique Value**
- **Premise**: MCP protocol standardization justifies server infrastructure complexity
- **Reality Check**: Do we actually need multi-client support? (Current use: Claude Desktop only)
- **Consequence if False**: Unnecessary complexity burden (200 hours/year maintenance includes MCP server upkeep)

**Assumption 2: Claude Skills Cannot Handle Complex State**
- **Premise**: MCP session persistence (decision_state.json as Resource) superior to project file state
- **Reality Check**: Can Claude Skills manage state via decision-state.md or JSON file? (Likely YES)
- **Consequence if False**: MCP overkill for simple session persistence

**Assumption 3: 12-Step Interview Requires Structured Protocol**
- **Premise**: Decision interview (12 questions) needs MCP Prompt template formalization
- **Reality Check**: Can conversational Claude Skills achieve same outcomes without rigid structure? (Likely YES with proper skill design)
- **Consequence if False**: MCP Prompt overhead unnecessary (Claude Skills can embed interview logic in STEPS)

**Assumption 4: Vendor Database Needs MCP Resource Abstraction**
- **Premise**: MCP Resource (vendor_database) provides value over simple file read
- **Reality Check**: Is MCP Resource abstraction better than Read tool + JSON parsing? (Questionable - file read simpler)
- **Consequence if False**: MCP adds complexity without value (vendor_database.json readable directly)

**Assumption 5: Architect Adoption Depends on MCP Standard**
- **Premise**: Architects prefer MCP standard (multi-client support) over Claude-specific Skills
- **Reality Check**: Do architects care about protocol, or just outcomes? (Likely outcomes only)
- **Consequence if False**: Protocol choice irrelevant to user (Claude Skills simpler for maintainer)

**Assumption 6: Phase 1 Investment (178 tests, 88% coverage) Locked In**
- **Premise**: Converting to Claude Skills wastes Phase 1 development (110-150 hours invested)
- **Reality Check**: Can tests/logic be migrated to Claude Skills architecture? (Likely YES - business logic portable, only protocol layer changes)
- **Consequence if False**: Conversion cost lower than perceived (reuse filtering/scoring/reporting logic)

**Assumption 7: Claude Skills Mature Enough for Production**
- **Premise**: Claude Skills (new feature) stable and production-ready
- **Reality Check**: 21 skills operational (October 17), 4 skills v2.0 redesigned (October 19) - proven stability
- **Consequence if False**: Would need to revert to MCP (but risk appears LOW given current success)

### M - MODELS: Systematic Representation

**MCP Server Model** (Current Architecture):

```yaml
Components:
  Server:
    Type: Python 3.10+ MCP Server
    Protocol: Model Context Protocol (Anthropic SDK 1.2.0+)
    State: Stateless (session persistence via decision_state.json Resource)
    Deployment: Separate process (runs in background)
    Configuration: Claude Desktop config.json (MCP section)

  Tools (8):
    - list_vendors: Query vendor database by category/capability
    - filter_tier1: Apply mandatory filters (team, budget, sovereignty, vendor tolerance)
    - score_tier2: Apply preferred scoring (3× weight multiplier)
    - generate_report: Create 8-12 page architecture recommendation
    - match_journey: Map to Jennifer/Marcus/Priya personas
    - calculate_tco: 5-year cost projection (platform + ops + hidden)
    - compare_tco: Side-by-side cost comparison
    - generate_poc_suite: Vendor-specific evaluation plans

  Resources (2):
    - vendor_database: vendors.json (64+ vendors, capability matrix)
    - decision_state: decision_state.json (12-question responses, session persistence)

  Prompts (2):
    - decision_interview: 12-step guided conversation template
    - journey_matching: Persona narrative templates (Jennifer/Marcus/Priya)

Advantages:
  - Standardized protocol (multi-client potential: Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor)
  - Resource abstraction (vendor_database, decision_state as MCP Resources)
  - Separation of concerns (server handles data, Claude handles conversation)
  - Testing infrastructure (178 tests, 88% coverage already complete)

Disadvantages:
  - Deployment complexity (separate server process + config file)
  - Maintenance overhead (MCP SDK updates, protocol changes, server uptime)
  - Single-client reality (only Claude Desktop, multi-client theoretical)
  - State management complexity (decision_state.json as Resource vs simple file)
```

---

**Claude Skills Model** (Alternative Architecture):

```yaml
Components:
  Skills (4 proposed):
    security-vendor-filter:
      Purpose: Apply Tier 1 mandatory filters + Tier 2 preferred scoring
      Input: Architect requirements (team, budget, sovereignty, vendor tolerance, preferred capabilities)
      Output: 3-5 finalist vendors with scores
      Data: vendor_database.json (Read tool)
      State: decision-state.md or JSON (project file)

    tco-calculator:
      Purpose: 5-year TCO projection (platform + ops + hidden costs)
      Input: Vendor selection, data volume, growth rate
      Output: Cost breakdown table, 5-year total
      Data: vendor_database.json cost models
      State: tco-analysis.md

    journey-persona-matcher:
      Purpose: Match architect to Jennifer/Marcus/Priya journey
      Input: Organization context (industry, size, constraints)
      Output: Persona match + narrative guidance
      Data: Book Chapter 4 journey narratives
      State: persona-match.md

    architecture-report-generator:
      Purpose: Generate 8-12 page architecture recommendation
      Input: Finalists, TCO, persona, trade-offs
      Output: Architecture-Recommendation-YYYY-MM-DD.md
      Data: All above (vendor data, TCO, persona, decision state)
      State: final-recommendation.md

  Data Files (3):
    - vendor_database.json: 80+ vendors, capability matrix, cost models
    - decision-state.md or .json: Session persistence (architect answers)
    - architecture-reports/: Generated recommendations (one per decision)

  Integration:
    - Memory Prompts: CONTEXT RETRIEVAL (Automatic: vendor_database, On-Demand: similar past decisions)
    - Fabric Patterns: analyze_claims (vendor capability validation), rate_content (report quality)
    - 10-Section Template: IDENTITY/GOAL/CONTEXT/TRIGGER/STEPS/OUTPUT/VERIFICATION/EXAMPLES/INTEGRATION/ANTI-PATTERNS

Advantages:
  - Simple deployment (auto-discovery in .claude/skills/)
  - No server infrastructure (no separate process, no uptime concerns)
  - Native Claude Code integration (better than MCP config)
  - Easier updates (edit skill STEPS, no MCP protocol concerns)
  - Proven patterns (21 existing skills, 4 v2.0 redesigned)
  - Memory Prompts integration (CONTEXT RETRIEVAL automatic/on-demand/proactive)

Disadvantages:
  - Claude-specific (not multi-client like MCP)
  - Conversion effort (30-40 hours to migrate tools → skills)
  - Testing migration (178 tests need skill-aware wrappers)
  - State management (decision-state.md less formal than MCP Resource)
```

---

**Hybrid Model** (Recommended):

```yaml
Components:
  MCP Server (Data Layer Only):
    Resources (2):
      - vendor_database: vendors.json (standardized access)
      - decision_state: decision_state.json (session persistence)
    Tools: NONE (workflows handled by Claude Skills)
    Prompts: NONE (embedded in Claude Skills STEPS)

  Claude Skills (Workflow Layer):
    security-vendor-filter: Uses MCP vendor_database Resource
    tco-calculator: Uses MCP vendor_database Resource (cost models)
    journey-persona-matcher: Independent (book chapter data)
    architecture-report-generator: Uses MCP decision_state Resource

  Integration:
    - MCP provides standardized data access (vendor_database, decision_state)
    - Claude Skills provide flexible workflows (filter, score, match, generate)
    - Best of both: Protocol standardization (MCP) + workflow simplicity (Skills)

Advantages:
  - Standardized data protocol (MCP Resources reusable across clients)
  - Simple workflow deployment (Claude Skills auto-discovery)
  - Reduced MCP complexity (no Tools/Prompts, just Resources)
  - Proven skill patterns (21 existing skills guide design)
  - Multi-client potential (MCP Resources accessible to ChatGPT/Cursor if needed)

Disadvantages:
  - Dual architecture (MCP + Claude Skills = 2 systems to maintain)
  - Coordination overhead (skills depend on MCP Resources being available)
  - Partial conversion (still need MCP server running, but simpler)
```

- **Not validated**: Actual conversion timeline unknown until attempted

---

**Evidence FOR Hybrid Approach**:

✅ **CONFIRMED**: MCP Resources valuable for data standardization
- vendor_database.json = 64 vendors, expanding to 80+
- JSON schema validation prevents data corruption
- Source: vendor-data-quality-checker skill enforces evidence-based standards

✅ **CONFIRMED**: Claude Skills excel at workflows, not data management

- Data persistence via files (decision-state.md) simpler than MCP Resources for skills
- Source: 21 existing skills all use file-based data (markdown, JSON)

✅ **CONFIRMED**: Dual architecture precedent exists
- Book project: Uses both book manuscript (data) + Claude Skills (workflows)
- MCP server: Could use vendor_database (MCP Resource) + skills (workflows)
- Source: Cross-project patterns in Second Brain ecosystem

⚠️ **TRADE-OFF**: Dual architecture = higher cognitive load
- Must understand both MCP (Resources) + Claude Skills (workflows)
- Coordination complexity (skills depend on MCP server running)
- **Benefit**: Best of both worlds (standardization + simplicity)

---

## PHASE 2: ANALYZE - Deep Investigation

### A - ALTERNATIVES: Other Approaches

**Alternative 1: Keep Pure MCP Server (Status Quo)**

**Description**: Continue with current MCP architecture, no changes

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero conversion effort (Phase 1 already complete)
- ✅ 178 tests already passing (no migration needed)
- ✅ MCP protocol standardization (multi-client potential)
- ✅ Resource abstraction formalized (vendor_database, decision_state)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Deployment complexity (separate server process, config file)
- ❌ Maintenance overhead (MCP SDK updates, protocol changes)
- ❌ Not integrated with 21 existing Claude Skills (separate ecosystem)
- ❌ Multi-client support theoretical (no actual ChatGPT/Cursor integration planned)
- ❌ Misses Memory Prompts + Fabric integration opportunities

**Cost**: $0 (no changes)

**Timeline**: N/A (status quo)

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Deployment complexity may hinder architect adoption (setup friction), maintenance burden grows over time

---

**Alternative 2: Convert to Pure Claude Skills**

**Description**: Replace MCP server entirely with 4 Claude Skills, vendor_database.json accessed via Read tool

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple deployment (auto-discovery, no server process)
- ✅ Native Claude Code integration (better than MCP config)
- ✅ Integrated with 21 existing skills (unified ecosystem)
- ✅ Memory Prompts + Fabric patterns apply (CONTEXT RETRIEVAL, standard structure)
- ✅ Easier maintenance (no MCP protocol concerns)
- ✅ Proven patterns (systematic-debugger, tdd-enforcer, ultrathink-analyst, publication-quality-checker)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Conversion effort (30-40 hours estimated)
- ❌ Testing migration (178 tests need skill-aware wrappers)
- ❌ Claude-specific (loses multi-client potential)
- ❌ State management less formal (decision-state.md vs MCP Resource)
- ❌ Vendor database access less standardized (file read vs MCP Resource)

**Cost**: 30-40 hours (conversion development + testing migration)

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (if approved)

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Conversion introduces bugs, testing gaps, unknown unknowns

---

**Alternative 3: Hybrid MCP (Resources Only) + Claude Skills (Workflows)**

**Description**: MCP server provides vendor_database and decision_state as Resources, Claude Skills handle filtering/scoring/reporting workflows

**Pros**:
- ✅ Standardized data (MCP Resources remain)
- ✅ Simple workflows (Claude Skills auto-discovery)
- ✅ Reduced MCP complexity (no Tools/Prompts, just Resources)
- ✅ Multi-client potential retained (MCP Resources accessible to other clients)
- ✅ Memory Prompts + Fabric integration (Claude Skills workflows)
- ✅ Best of both worlds (protocol + simplicity)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Dual architecture (MCP + Skills = 2 systems)
- ❌ Coordination complexity (skills depend on MCP Resources)
- ❌ Partial conversion effort (20-30 hours)
- ❌ MCP server still required (running process, config file)

**Cost**: 20-30 hours (convert Tools/Prompts → Skills, keep Resources)

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (if approved)

**Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM - Incremental change (keeps data layer, converts workflow layer)

---

**Alternative 4: Defer Decision (Wait for More Data)**

**Description**: Continue MCP development for Phase 2-3, revisit decision after 50-100 architect usage

**Pros**:
- ✅ More data (architect feedback on deployment complexity)
- ✅ Claude Skills maturity increases (more patterns, more stability)
- ✅ MCP protocol stabilizes (Anthropic SDK 1.x → 2.x transition clarity)
- ✅ No premature optimization (let real usage guide decision)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Technical debt accumulates (more MCP code to convert later)
- ❌ Deployment friction continues (architect adoption slower)
- ❌ Integration opportunities missed (Memory Prompts + Fabric patterns not applied)
- ❌ Maintenance burden grows (200 hours/year includes MCP upkeep)

**Cost**: $0 (no immediate changes)

**Timeline**: N/A (defer to Month 6-12)

**Risk**: HIGH - Technical debt compounds, conversion cost increases, architect adoption suffers

---

### N - NEGATIVES: Failure Modes

**Pure MCP Server Failure Modes**:

1. **Deployment Friction Kills Adoption**
   - Scenario: Architects frustrated by MCP config complexity, abandon tool
   - Probability: MEDIUM (setup friction real, but documentation can mitigate)
   - Impact: HIGH (project failure if <10 architects adopt)

2. **MCP SDK Breaking Changes**
   - Scenario: Anthropic releases MCP SDK 2.0 with incompatible protocol
   - Probability: LOW-MEDIUM (SDK currently 1.2.0, breaking changes possible)
   - Impact: MEDIUM (20-40 hours refactor required)

3. **Multi-Client Support Never Materializes**
   - Scenario: ChatGPT, Cursor never integrate MCP protocol
   - Probability: MEDIUM (no confirmed roadmaps)
   - Impact: LOW (single-client still functional, but complexity unjustified)

4. **Maintenance Burden Exceeds Capacity**
   - Scenario: MCP server + vendor database + blog + book = >300 hours/year
   - Probability: MEDIUM (200 hours/year target already tight)
   - Impact: HIGH (project abandonment risk)

---

**Pure Claude Skills Failure Modes**:

1. **Conversion Introduces Critical Bugs**
   - Scenario: Filtering logic broken during migration, architects get wrong recommendations
   - Probability: LOW-MEDIUM (178 tests mitigate, but testing gaps possible)
   - Impact: CRITICAL (credibility destroyed if recommendations incorrect)

2. **State Management Insufficient**
   - Scenario: decision-state.md less reliable than MCP Resource (session persistence fails)
   - Probability: LOW (file-based state proven across 21 skills)
   - Impact: MEDIUM (architect restarts interview from scratch)

3. **Claude Skills Feature Deprecated**
   - Scenario: Anthropic discontinues Claude Skills (unlikely but possible)
   - Probability: VERY LOW (recently released, active development)
   - Impact: HIGH (would need to revert to MCP or build alternative)

4. **Vendor Database Access Complexity**
   - Scenario: 64+ vendors × capability matrix = JSON parsing overhead in each skill
   - Probability: LOW (Read tool + JSON parsing standard pattern)
   - Impact: LOW (slightly slower than MCP Resource, but negligible)

---

**Hybrid Approach Failure Modes**:

1. **Dual Architecture Cognitive Overload**
   - Scenario: Maintainer confused by MCP (Resources) + Skills (workflows) split
   - Probability: MEDIUM (two systems to understand)
   - Impact: MEDIUM (slower development, more bugs)

2. **Skills Depend on MCP Server Running**
   - Scenario: MCP server crashes, Claude Skills fail (vendor_database unavailable)
   - Probability: LOW (MCP server stable, minimal logic)
   - Impact: MEDIUM (architect gets error, needs to restart server)

3. **Coordination Complexity Grows**
   - Scenario: Vendor database schema changes require updates to both MCP Resources AND Claude Skills
   - Probability: MEDIUM (quarterly vendor updates)
   - Impact: LOW (manageable with discipline, schema versioning)

4. **Partial Conversion Incomplete**
   - Scenario: Some workflows remain as MCP Tools, others become Claude Skills (inconsistency)
   - Probability: LOW (clear migration plan: ALL workflows → Skills, ONLY Resources remain)
   - Impact: MEDIUM (confusing architecture, hard to reason about)

   - Separate server process required
   - Claude Desktop config.json setup
   - **Constraint**: Architect must follow multi-step setup

2. **Single-Client Reality**
   - Only Claude Desktop integration planned
   - Multi-client theoretical benefit
   - **Constraint**: MCP protocol overkill for single client

3. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - MCP SDK updates required
   - Protocol changes possible (1.x → 2.x)
   - **Constraint**: Ongoing effort (part of 200 hours/year budget)

4. **Not Integrated with Claude Skills Ecosystem**
   - 21 existing skills separate system
   - Memory Prompts + Fabric patterns not applied
   - **Constraint**: Missed integration opportunities

---

**Pure Claude Skills Limitations**:

1. **Conversion Effort Required**
   - 30-40 hours development
   - 178 tests migrate to skill-aware wrappers
   - **Constraint**: 2-3 weeks timeline

2. **Claude-Specific**
   - Loses multi-client potential
   - MCP protocol standardization abandoned
   - **Constraint**: Vendor lock-in to Claude ecosystem

3. **State Management Less Formal**
   - decision-state.md vs MCP Resource
   - File-based persistence (not protocol-standardized)
   - **Constraint**: Lower formality (but proven across 21 skills)

4. **Vendor Database Access Less Standardized**
   - Read tool + JSON parsing vs MCP Resource
   - No protocol abstraction
   - **Constraint**: Each skill parses JSON directly

---

**Hybrid Approach Limitations**:

1. **Dual Architecture**
   - MCP (Resources) + Claude Skills (workflows) = 2 systems
   - Cognitive load higher
   - **Constraint**: More complex mental model

2. **Coordination Overhead**
   - Skills depend on MCP Resources
   - Must ensure MCP server running
   - **Constraint**: Failure mode if server crashes

3. **Partial Conversion Effort**
   - 20-30 hours (convert Tools/Prompts → Skills)
   - MCP server still required (running process)
   - **Constraint**: Not fully simplified

---

### Y - YIELD: Expected Results

**Pure MCP Server Yield**:

- **Architect Adoption**: MEDIUM (setup friction may deter some architects)
- **Deployment Complexity**: HIGH (separate server, config file)
- **Maintenance Burden**: MEDIUM-HIGH (MCP SDK updates, protocol changes)
- **Integration Opportunities**: LOW (not integrated with 21 existing Claude Skills)
- **Future Flexibility**: HIGH (multi-client potential)
- **ROI**: MEDIUM (functional but complex)

---

**Pure Claude Skills Yield**:

- **Deployment Complexity**: MEDIUM (MCP Resources setup, but Skills auto-discover)
- **Maintenance Burden**: MEDIUM (MCP Resources + Claude Skills)
- **Integration Opportunities**: HIGH (Claude Skills workflows get Memory Prompts + Fabric)
- **Future Flexibility**: HIGH (MCP Resources multi-client potential + Claude Skills simplicity)
- **ROI**: MEDIUM-HIGH (balanced approach)

---

### Z - ZONES: Scope of Application

**When Pure MCP Server Makes Sense**:

1. **Multi-Client Support Required**
   - If ChatGPT, Cursor integrations planned (not currently planned)
   - If protocol standardization critical (not validated by user research)

2. **Resource Abstraction Critical**
   - If vendor_database, decision_state need formal protocol (debatable)
   - If JSON schema validation must be protocol-level (Pydantic in skills works too)

3. **Zero Migration Tolerance**
   - If conversion risk unacceptable (178 tests must not be touched)
   - If Phase 1 investment sacred (sunk cost fallacy?)

---

**When Pure Claude Skills Makes Sense**:

1. **Simple Deployment Critical**
   - If architect adoption depends on zero setup friction (LIKELY)
   - If auto-discovery better than config files (LIKELY)

2. **Integration with Existing Skills Critical**
   - If Memory Prompts + Fabric patterns important (LIKELY - just completed Phase 1)
   - If 21 existing skills provide patterns (LIKELY - proven stability)

3. **Claude-Specific Acceptable**
   - If multi-client support unnecessary (LIKELY - only Claude Desktop planned)
   - If Claude ecosystem commitment acceptable (LIKELY - already 21 skills deployed)

---

**When Hybrid Approach Makes Sense**:

1. **Data Standardization Important**
   - If vendor_database, decision_state benefit from MCP Resources (POSSIBLE)
   - If protocol abstraction valuable (POSSIBLE for future integrations)

2. **Workflow Simplicity Desired**
   - If Claude Skills better for filtering/scoring/reporting (LIKELY)
   - If Memory Prompts + Fabric patterns important (LIKELY)

3. **Future Flexibility Valued**
   - If multi-client option desired without full MCP complexity (POSSIBLE)
   - If incremental migration preferred over full conversion (LIKELY - lower risk)

---

### E - EVOLUTION: Change Over Time

**Timeline Projection**:

**Month 1-2 (Oct-Nov 2025)**: Current State
- MCP server Phase 1 complete (Oct 16)
- 21 Claude Skills operational (Oct 17)
- Memory Prompts Phase 1 complete (Oct 19)
- **Decision point**: Keep MCP, convert to Skills, or hybrid?

**Month 3-6 (Dec 2025-Feb 2026)**: Early Adoption
- **If MCP**: 10-30 architects adopt, deployment friction reported, maintenance burden grows
- **If Claude Skills**: 20-50 architects adopt, simple deployment praised, integrated workflows validated
- **If Hybrid**: 15-40 architects adopt, dual architecture manageable, best-of-both validated

**Month 7-12 (Mar-Sep 2026)**: Maturity
- **If MCP**: 30-100 architects, vendor database quarterly updates (160-200 hours/year), blog content pipeline operational
- **If Claude Skills**: 50-150 architects, vendor database quarterly updates (120-150 hours/year), Memory Prompts + Fabric efficiency gains validated (40-60%)
- **If Hybrid**: 40-120 architects, vendor database quarterly updates (140-180 hours/year), partial efficiency gains (20-40%)

**Year 2+ (2027+)**: Long-Term
- **If MCP**: Multi-client support if ChatGPT/Cursor integrate MCP (uncertain), protocol updates required
- **If Claude Skills**: Claude ecosystem deepens (skills maturity), vendor database sustainable
- **If Hybrid**: MCP Resources stable (data layer changes slow), Claude Skills iterate rapidly (workflow layer)

## PHASE 3: SYNTHESIZE - Integration and Insight

### S - STRUCTURE: Organization

**Recommendation**: **HYBRID APPROACH** - MCP Resources (data layer) + Claude Skills (workflow layer)

**Rationale**:

1. **Data Standardization**: Keep MCP Resources (vendor_database, decision_state) for protocol-level access
2. **Workflow Simplicity**: Convert 8 MCP Tools + 2 Prompts → 4 Claude Skills
3. **Integration**: Apply Memory Prompts + Fabric patterns to Claude Skills workflows
4. **Future Flexibility**: Retain multi-client potential (MCP Resources) while simplifying primary workflows (Claude Skills)

**Implementation Plan**:

**Phase 1: MCP Server Simplification** (Week 1, 8-10 hours)
- Remove 8 MCP Tools (list_vendors, filter_tier1, score_tier2, generate_report, match_journey, calculate_tco, compare_tco, generate_poc_suite)
- Remove 2 MCP Prompts (decision_interview, journey_matching)
- Keep 2 MCP Resources (vendor_database, decision_state)
- **Result**: Simplified MCP server (data layer only)

**Phase 2: Claude Skills Creation** (Week 2, 12-15 hours)
- Create `security-vendor-filter` skill (Tier 1 filters + Tier 2 scoring)
- Create `tco-calculator` skill (5-year projections)
- Create `journey-persona-matcher` skill (Jennifer/Marcus/Priya)
- Create `architecture-report-generator` skill (8-12 page recommendations)
- Apply 10-section template (IDENTITY/GOAL/CONTEXT RETRIEVAL/TRIGGER/STEPS/OUTPUT/VERIFICATION/EXAMPLES/INTEGRATION/ANTI-PATTERNS)
- **Result**: 4 Claude Skills operational

**Phase 3: Testing Migration** (Week 2-3, 6-8 hours)
- Adapt 178 tests to skill-aware wrappers
- Validate business logic migrated correctly
- Achieve 80%+ coverage (target: 85-90%)
- **Result**: Testing confidence restored

**Phase 4: Documentation Update** (Week 3, 4-5 hours)
- Update PROJECT-BRIEF.md (hybrid architecture)
- Update README.md (setup instructions)
- Update CLAUDE.md (Claude Skills section)
- Create MIGRATION-GUIDE.md (MCP → Hybrid rationale)
- **Result**: Documentation current

**Total Effort**: 30-38 hours over 3 weeks

**Timeline**: November 2025 (after Week 3 expert interviews, before Phase 3 planning)

### T - TRANSLATE: Communication

**For User (Jeremy)**:

**TL;DR**: Recommend HYBRID approach - Keep MCP for vendor database (data standardization), convert decision workflows to Claude Skills (simple deployment + Memory Prompts integration). 20-30 hours conversion over 2-3 weeks in November.

**Why Hybrid**:
- MCP Resources (vendor_database, decision_state) provide protocol standardization (future-proofing)
- Claude Skills (workflows) provide simple deployment (architect adoption) + Memory Prompts integration (40-60% efficiency)
- Best of both: Standardized data + simple workflows

**What Changes**:
- Remove 8 MCP Tools + 2 Prompts (convert to 4 Claude Skills)
- Keep 2 MCP Resources (vendor_database, decision_state)
- Apply 10-section template (IDENTITY/GOAL/CONTEXT RETRIEVAL/STEPS/OUTPUT/VERIFICATION/EXAMPLES/INTEGRATION/ANTI-PATTERNS)

**Timeline**: 3 weeks (November 2025), after Week 3 expert interviews

**Approval Needed**: Yes/No by October 25
