**Target**: Security architects, CISO community, data engineering leaders

**Draft**:

```
üöÄ Launching: Security Architect MCP Server (Open Source)

After 6 months building the "Modern Data Stack for Cybersecurity" book,
I've turned the decision framework into an AI-powered tool that helps
security architects evaluate 80+ security data platforms in 30 minutes
(instead of 2-4 weeks).

What it does:
‚úÖ Filters 71 vendors based on YOUR constraints (budget, team, sovereignty)
‚úÖ Scores platforms on YOUR priorities (3√ó weight multiplier)
‚úÖ Generates architecture reports with honest trade-offs
‚úÖ Projects 5-year TCO with growth modeling
‚úÖ Matches you to proven architecture patterns

What makes it different:
üî¨ Evidence-based (production deployments, not marketing)
ü§ù Vendor-neutral (no sponsorships, open source)
üí¨ Conversational (Claude Desktop, not rigid forms)

Tech: Python MCP server, 71 vendors, 144 tests, 87% coverage

Seeking 3-5 beta testers:
‚Ä¢ Healthcare (HIPAA compliance)
‚Ä¢ Financial services (cloud-first)
‚Ä¢ Multi-national (data sovereignty)

### Recruitment Message

```
Subject: Beta Testing Invitation: Security Platform Selection Tool

Hi [Name],

I'm launching an open-source AI-powered decision support tool for
security architects evaluating data platforms (SIEM, query engines,
lakehouses, etc.). It filters 80+ vendors to 3-5 finalists in 30 minutes.

I'm looking for 3-5 beta testers to validate the tool with real
architectural decisions. Your feedback will directly shape Phase 2-3
development.

What you'd do:
‚Ä¢ 30-minute decision interview with Claude Desktop (conversational)
‚Ä¢ Review architecture report (8-12 pages with finalists + TCO)
‚Ä¢ 15-minute feedback call (what worked, what didn't)

What you get:
‚Ä¢ Free architecture recommendation report (normally $5K+ from consultants)
‚Ä¢ Early access to tool before public release
‚Ä¢ Co-design Phase 2-3 features

Timeline: This week or next (flexible)

Interested? Let me know your context (industry, team size, rough budget)
and I'll send setup instructions.

GitHub: [link]

Thanks,
Jeremy

- [ ] LinkedIn post published (target: 50+ reactions)
- [ ] Reddit posts published (target: 20+ upvotes)
- [ ] 5-10 beta tester inquiries

### Phase 2 (Beta Testing)
- [ ] 3-5 beta testers recruited
- [ ] 3-5 architecture reports generated
- [ ] 3-5 feedback sessions completed
- [ ] 80%+ "would recommend" rate

### Phase 3 (Iteration)
- [ ] Top 3 issues fixed
- [ ] 1-2 anonymized case studies published

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Beta Tester Response
**Mitigation**: Offer free architecture report ($5K+ value), emphasize 30-minute time commitment

### Risk 2: Tool Doesn't Match Real Needs
**Mitigation**: That's the point of beta testing! Feedback informs Phase 2-3

### Risk 3: Setup Too Complex
**Mitigation**: Offer 15-minute setup calls, improve docs/SETUP.md

### Risk 4: TCO Projections Inaccurate
**Mitigation**: ¬±20% accuracy disclaimer, collect actual costs for calibration
