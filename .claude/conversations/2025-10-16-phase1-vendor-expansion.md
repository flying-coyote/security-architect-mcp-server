## Database Statistics

### Before Phase 1
- Total Vendors: 10
- Categories: 4
- Query Engines: 2
- Data Virtualization: 2
- Data Lakehouses: 2
- SIEM: 4

### After Phase 1
- Total Vendors: 24 (+140%)
- Categories: 4
- Query Engines: 5 (+150%)
- Data Virtualization: 3 (+50%)
- Data Lakehouses: 5 (+150%)
- SIEM: 11 (+175%)

### Quality Metrics

- Evidence Sources: 100% (all vendors cite sources)
- Cost Data: 100% (all vendors have pricing ranges)
- Test Coverage: 93%

---

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Phase 1 Target: 14 Vendors (Not 15)
**Decision**: Added 14 vendors instead of planned 15
**Rationale**: Starburst Enterprise already exists in database with virtualization capabilities (multi_engine_query: true), eliminating duplication
**Trade-off**: Slightly below plan, but avoids redundancy and maintains data quality
**Outcome**: 24 total vendors (vs. planned 25)

### 2. SIEM Category Priority
**Decision**: Added 7 SIEM platforms (most of any category)
**Rationale**: SIEM is most crowded and critical category for architects, comprehensive coverage essential
**Trade-off**: More time spent on SIEM research vs. other categories
**Outcome**: 11 SIEM platforms (275% growth), now most comprehensive category

### 3. Open Source Lakehouse Focus
**Decision**: All 3 lakehouse additions are open source table formats
**Rationale**: Delta Lake, Hudi, Iceberg are foundational technologies used across multiple platforms
**Trade-off**: Could have added more commercial lakehouses, but OSS formats more broadly applicable
**Outcome**: Strong open source representation (7/24 vendors = 29%)

### 4. Evidence-Based Validation
**Decision**: Mandatory evidence_source field with citations
**Rationale**: Second-brain quality standards require defensible claims
**Trade-off**: Slower data entry, but higher trust and accuracy
**Outcome**: 100% of vendors cite sources (vendor docs, Apache Foundation, analyst reports)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Batch web searches**: Running multiple searches in parallel sped up research significantly
2. **Evidence-based approach**: Citing sources upfront prevented rework
3. **Incremental testing**: Updating tests immediately after data entry caught issues early
4. **Category focus**: Prioritizing SIEM expansion addressed most critical architect need

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Vendor count discrepancy**: Realized Starburst duplication after data entry
2. **SIEM category explosion**: 7 new platforms required more research than expected
3. **Pricing data variability**: Many vendors don't publish transparent pricing (required estimates)
4. **Capability matrix consistency**: Ensuring 25+ dimensions filled for each vendor took time

### Would Do Differently
1. **Pre-validate duplicates**: Check existing database before adding to avoid Starburst issue
2. **Batch similar vendors**: Research all SIEM vendors together to compare capabilities
3. **Template approach**: Create vendor JSON template to speed data entry
4. **Pricing research strategy**: Start with analyst reports (Gartner/Forrester) for cost validation
